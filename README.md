# TDD-demystified

This is the code base of our related talk given at [XP Days Germany 2018](https://www.xpdays.de/2018/sessions/174-tdd-demystified.html) and [JBFOne 2018](https://kms.jbfone.de/public/conferences/2/agendas/3)

The whole session was recorded using a [screencast tool](http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php). Every save action lead also to taken a [sceenshot](https://imagemagick.org/script/import.php) and to a git commit. We did this by writing a [tiny shell script](https://gist.github.com/pfichtner/a0d202769209d968c3268dff72a2172c). 
We also did record every eclipse key and mouse event using [fluorite](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fluorite/index.html). Thr resulted log can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/pfichtner/f695536c2bdc453871497282209feb93#file-log2018-11-02-19-52-57-582-xml).
