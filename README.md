# TDD-demystified

This is the code base of our related talk given at [XP Days Germany 2018](https://www.xpdays.de/2018/sessions/174-tdd-demystified.html) and [JBFOne 2018](https://kms.jbfone.de/public/conferences/2/agendas/3)
XP Days slides can be found on the [their website](https://www.xpdays.de/2018/downloads/174-tdd-demystified/tdd_demystified.pdf) and [in our gist](https://gist.github.com/tglaser/02cdfde62e116733d87ad43802f7199e#file-hah_tdd_demystified) (german version, only).

The whole coding session was recorded using a [screencast tool](http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php) and the videos will be available soon. Each save action lead also to taken a [sceenshot](https://imagemagick.org/script/import.php) and to a git commit. We did this by writing a [tiny shell script](https://gist.github.com/pfichtner/a0d202769209d968c3268dff72a2172c). 
We also did record every eclipse key and mouse event using [fluorite](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fluorite/index.html). The resulted log can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/pfichtner/f695536c2bdc453871497282209feb93#file-log2018-11-02-19-52-57-582-xml).
