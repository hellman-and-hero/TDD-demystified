# TDD-demystified

This is the code base of our related talk given at [XP Days Germany 2018](https://www.xpdays.de/2018/sessions/174-tdd-demystified.html) and [JBFOne 2018](https://kms.jbfone.de/public/conferences/2/agendas/3)

The whole session was recorded using [screencast tool](http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php). Every save action lead also to taken a [sceenshot](https://imagemagick.org/script/import.php) and to a git commit. We did this by writing a [tiny shell script](https://gist.github.com/pfichtner/a0d202769209d968c3268dff72a2172c)
